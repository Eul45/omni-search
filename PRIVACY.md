# OmniSearch Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-18

OmniSearch is a local desktop file search application for Windows.

## Data We Process

- File metadata on your local drives (for example: file name, path, size, dates) to build a local search index.
- App settings you choose (for example: selected theme and filters).

## Data We Do Not Collect

- We do not create user accounts.
- We do not sell personal data.
- We do not send your indexed file metadata to our servers.

## Data Storage

- Index and settings are stored locally on your device.
- Installer/download analytics may be processed by third-party hosting platforms (for example GitHub Releases or your file host) according to their own policies.

## Security

- OmniSearch runs on your device and accesses files with the permissions granted by Windows.
- You are responsible for device-level security, account permissions, and backup practices.

## Third-Party Components

- OmniSearch uses open-source dependencies (for example Tauri, Rust, C++, and related libraries) that may have their own licenses and policies.

## Your Choices

- You can uninstall OmniSearch at any time.
- You can clear local app data by removing the app data folders on your device.
